# Assignment 5 Sentiment Classification with CNNs 

Both the [dynet](https://github.com/neubig/nn4nlp-code/blob/master/05-cnn/cnn-class.py) and [pytorch](https://github.com/neubig/nn4nlp-code/blob/master/05-cnn-pytorch/cnn-class.py) implementations achieve ~41% accuracy in this task. Our model slightly exceeds their performance and achieves ~43% accuracy on the validation set.
The file CNN is the one which gives the slightly higher accuracy. The file CNN-2 has more or less the same arcitecture as the dynet implementation and it gives the same performance.
